find . -name filename //search in current location

find .-type f -name filename
grep -w "wordname" filename //search in text
grep -n "wordname" filename //search in text with line number
grep -v "wordname" filename //search in text not containing "wordname"
grep -c "wordname" filename //search in text count number of that word
ls -l //list all files with details
ls -l filename
chmod u=x (username) filename //giving read write access to user
chmod u-x (username) filename //remove access permission
chmod u-r (username) filename //remove read permission
chmod u-w (username) filename //remove write permission
sed -i 's/oldtext/newtext/g' filename // find word and replace
sed -i 's/oldtext/newtext/g' filename > newfilename // find word and replace and store in newfile


1. To create a directory use mkdir command:  mkdir directory_name

2. To delete a directory use rmdir command: rmdir directory_name

3. To change directory from one location to another use cd command: cd directory_name with path location

4. To show the list of directories and files in a current directory use ls command: ls
 
5. To copy contents of one file to another, use the cp command: cp test.txt copytest.txt

6. To move/cut files from one location to another use rm command: rm your file_name destination path location

7. Create File:  touch file1 file2 file3, which creates three files in your current directory.
    
8. To display the contents of the file, use the cat (short for concatenation) command:  cat test.txt

9. A file can be renamed by moving it. The same can be achieved by using the mv command: mv test3.txt newtest3.txt

10. grep: The grep command is used to search text. It searches the given file for lines containing a match to the given strings or words. It is one of the most useful commands on Linux and Unix-like system. Let us see how to use grep on a Linux or Unix like system.

grep [options] pattern [file-list]


11. head: Displays the beginning of a file.

head [options] [file-list]

12. join: Joins lines from two files based on a common field

join [options] file1 file2

13. sort: Sorts and/or merges files

sort [options] [file-list]

14. tail: Displays the last part (tail) of a file

tail [options] [file-list]

15. uniq: Displays unique lines from a file

uniq [options] [input-file] [output-file]

16. diff: The diff (difference) utility compares two files and displays a list of the differences between them.


17. file: file command is used to determine the type of a file. .file type may be of human-readable(e.g. ‘ASCII text’) or MIME type(e.g. ‘text/plain; charset=us-ascii’)











Practice exercises (important, sheel scripting)
1. Suppose you are in Document directory. So Open Last Edited File in that directory. - ls -lt ; to open file: xdg-open filename

2. Print all the system information in the following order: Kernel name, network node hostname, kernel release date, kernel version, machine hardware name, hardware platform, operating system:

# Kernel name
echo "Kernel Name: $(uname -s)"

# Network node hostname
echo "Hostname: $(uname -n)"

# Kernel release date
echo "Kernel Release Date: $(uname -v)"

# Kernel version
echo "Kernel Version: $(uname -r)"

# Machine hardware name
echo "Machine Hardware: $(uname -m)"

# Hardware platform
echo "Hardware Platform: $(uname -i)"

# Operating System
echo "Operating System: $(lsb_release -d -s)"


3. Display content in reverse order of a file: tac filename or tail -r filename

4. Display the current date in the form of dd/mm/yy.: date +'%d/%m/%y'

5. How do your display both date and time in the format of dd-mm-yy/hh.mm.ss?: date +'%d-%m-%y/%H.%M.%S'


6.  Copy a file from Desktop to a directory under Documents directory.: cp ~/Desktop/myfile.txt ~/Documents/mydir/


7. Make a directory in Pictures with the name My Photos.: mkdir ~/Pictures/My\ Photos

8. Search through the memo file for lines that contain the string credit and displays the single line that meets this criterion.: grep 'credit' memo

9. Let us assume there are two files file1.txt and file2.txt and we want to combine the contents of these two files.  Furthermore, create a new file with the joined contents.: cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt


10. Removes all the duplicate lines in a text file.: sort input.txt | uniq > output.txt

11. Let's say you have a file, data.txt, which contains the following ASCII text:
apples
oranges
pears
kiwis
bananas
Sort the contents in the file in reverse alphabetic order (descending order).
: sort -r data.txt -o data.txt


12. Find the string “the” containing in a text file name “myfile.txt”.: grep 'the' myfile.txt


13. Order Files Based on Last Modified Time (In Reverse Order).:
cd /path/to/your/directory
ls -t -r

14. Recursively remove all files and directories under the example directory.: rm -rf /path/to/example


15. Display the file contents with the line number to each line of the output.: nl filename


16. Create a directory called temp under your home directory.: mkdir ~/temp

17. View all the network interfaces along with status.: ifconfig -a or ip link show
